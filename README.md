Parkinson's Decision Support Classifier

This project was carried out by Daniel Marchán, Alejandro Lillo, Diego López and Marvin Fernández for the Decision Support Systems course.

The program will be used mainly by medical stuff such as nurses or doctors, but it could be used as well by trained non-medical stuff that need to be familiar with the different
motor scales used in our program. This would facilitate the time of phase detection of the disease by only needing a visual and some survey intervention from the assessor to
the patients. Also, the program is capable of giving advice to the medical expert on the treatment the patient could follow, however, the final decision is up to the doctor. This
would decrease the medical expenses of consultation as well as the phase detection time of the disorders that directly implies with a faster and a more efficient treatment. 
It is related to biomedical engineering since it is a health issue that needs to be automatized, it provides support to the decision made by the doctors, as well as it
classify patients in a more standard way and provides a treatment recommendation.
